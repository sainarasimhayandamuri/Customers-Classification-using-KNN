# Customers-Classification-using-KNN

It is a customer classification project developed by Sai Narasimha.

## About

The model classifies the customers based on its category by using knn algorithm.

### Features

Removing non null values.
Performing Exploratory Data Analysis.
Converting categorical data into binary catergorical data.
Normalizing data to make it scale free and unitless.


## Steps to run this project

1. Download and install Anaconda-Navigator.

2. 
   1.) Open terminal, and type

      ```anaconda-navigator
      ```
   This will open anaconda-navigator in linux.
   
   2.) For windows you can search Anaconda Navigator in search bar.
   
You can use jupyter notebook or spyder for running the code.

Build model using KNN after normalizing the data and the neighbours will be choosen based on square root of columns.

After building the model evalute using confusion matrix and measure accuracy using accuracy score.
